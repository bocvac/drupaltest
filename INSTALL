INSTALL
=========
1. Delete the import.module from your drupal installation:
   rm /my/drupal/dir/modules/import.module
2. Drop the tables in mysql:
   DROP TABLE item;
   DROP TABLE feed;
   DROP TABLE bundle;
3. install the new tables:
   mysql -p database <import.mysql
4. Edit your .htacces. Put a # in fron of this line:
   php_value allow_call_time_pass_reference  Off
5. Copy *.inc to the includes directory:
   cp *.inc /my/drupal/dir/includes/
6. Copy *.module to the modules directory:
   cp *.module /my/drupal/dir/modules/
6. Go to the admin section, then module selector and enable feed and item modules.
   The import module is optional.
7. For the cron the work you must run cron.php as a user with the right permissions.
   (I created a user cron on my site to do this). Minimum should be access news feeds
   and administer news feeds.
   You can do this in two way. The first way is the less secure one. Call cron.php like this:
   http://example.com/cron.php?name=username&passwd=password
   The second version is more secure, but requires more work from your side.
   You can use Mozilla/Netscape to login as the user you wany (remember
   to check 'remember me'). Then you can use curl like this: 
   /usr/bin/curl -s --cookie /home/breyten/.mozilla/default/65frxpvt.slt/cookies.txt -o /dev/null "http://example.com/cron.php"
   (Note: according to the documentation wget can also work with mozilla cookie files,
   but I didn't get that to work -- the mozilla cookies.txt file is somewhere under ~/.mozilla.
   Use "find ~/.mozilla -name 'cookies.txt' -print" to find it.
).
8. Add feeds
9. Optionally tag feeds with taxonomy terms
9. Activate taxonomy_dhtml.module and click on 'news categories' to see 
news items grouped by taxonomy term (works best if you dedicate vocabulary(s) to the 'feed' node type)

enjoy!
