README
========
Previously this module was called import module. But because this name was used elsewhere
the module has been renamed. 

This is an alternative version of the aggregate module that comes with Drupal.
Read the INSTALL file carefully, installation of this module is not trivial.

The main advantage of the node_aggregate module suite is that RSS items are stored as 
first class nodes. That means that they can be promoted to home page, queued, commented upon, etc.

Further, RSS item nodes inherit the taxonomy terms that are assigned 
to their corrosponding feed. This rich tagging of items with taxonomy tags creates interesting
opportunities for pages consisting of composite feeds from various sites and 
even composite RSS feeds from multiple sites.

FEATURES
==========
 - Reads RSS 0.9x, 1.0 and 2.0 files
 - a block for each feed
 - (optional) auto-promotion of news items
 - when taxonomy_dhtml.module is enabled (see Contrib repository), offers a page grouping similarly tagged items
